# About the Project

This was my first time using SDL2 in C++, so it took me a while to get used to the basics. In the future I might add new features, such as on-screen text using SDL_tff or sound effects.

To compile, install Mingw64, SDL2, and SDL_Image. Then, find instructions online on how to compile SDL programs using your prefered software (I used Sublime Text).
